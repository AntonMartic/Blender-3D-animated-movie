# Lego-Landing-A-3D-Lego-Animation
Lego Landing is a short animated Lego film created using Blender for modeling and animation, Nuke for VFX and Adobe Premiere Pro for editing. The project was an exploration of 3D animation techniques, lighting, and rendering pipelines. The final animation consists of 5303 frames. This repository contains project files, assets and documentation.

## Features
- **Blender**: Used for modeling, animation, and rendering (Cycles).
- **Nuke**: Applied special effects like lens flares, chromatic aberration, vignette, and depth of field.
- **Adobe Premiere Pro**: Final editing and sequencing.
- **Storyboarding & Planning**: Structured workflow to improve efficiency.
- **Collaboration**: Team-based project with assigned tasks for better production flow.

## Technical Details
- **Frame Rate**: 25 FPS  
- **Total Frames**: 5303  
- **Final Duration**: ~3m 30s  
- **Rendering Time**: 20 hours (Blender Cycles + Nuke processing)

## Challenges & Solutions
- **Normals Issue**: Some frames had incorrect normals, requiring manual review and re-rendering.
- **Cycles Limitations**: Lack of built-in VFX tools led to post-processing in Nuke.
- **Rendering Time**: Optimized render settings to balance quality and efficiency.
